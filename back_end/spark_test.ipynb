Spin-modulated radial\\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\\ntheoretical model predictions of King &amp; Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\\naccretion curtain model.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\\n</td>\n",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

       "      <td>This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\\nwaves in slowly varying media.\\n</td>\n",

       "2     The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field\\nfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,\\nAmerican Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1).

       "7     A general formulation was developed to represent material models for\\napplications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate\\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\\naccuracy.

These\\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations.

       "8     We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy\\nobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set\\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies.

       "16    Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\\naccretion curtain model.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "22    The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\\nperiods in network regions.

The\\nexperiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the\\nshape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the\\nconfinement.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

A two order of magnitude decrease of error was\\ndemonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were\\nproven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate\\nshape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "42    We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice\\nBoltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without\\nblurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the\\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\\nquasiequilibria.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "43    We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\\nplasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\\nThe key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\\nmean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\\nfrequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\\napplications are discussed in detail.\\n   \n",
       "44    This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear\\nperiodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a\\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging\\nmethod, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\\nequations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\\nwaves in slowly varying media.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano\\n6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "49    Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II\\ndiscusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two\\ncontinuous acoustic emission sources.\\n  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of\\ndeveloping defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various\\nstatistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is\\nseparation and characterization of signal components when the signals from\\nvarious sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source\\nseparation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve\\nthese problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability\\nof ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission\\nsources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for\\nnon-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission\\nanalysis.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

We also present a lazy extension of our approach that leads to very significant speed ups in practice, and demonstrate the viability of our method empirically, on several real world datasets. One of our key new theoretical insights is a method for bounding the conditional mutual information of arbitrarily large sets of random variables with only a polynomial number of mutual information computations on fixed-size subsets of variables, when the underlying distribution can be approximated by a bounded treewidth junction tree.</td>\n",

In this paper, we introduce a local smoothness regularizer to semi-supervised boosting algorithms based on the universal optimization framework of margin cost functionals. Our regularizer is applicable to existing semi-supervised boosting algorithms to improve their generalization and speed up their training. Comparative results on synthetic, benchmark and real world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our local smoothness regularizer.

Furthermore, the transparency of this new learning rule makes a theoretical analysis of its convergence properties feasible. A variation of this learning rule (with sign changes) provides a theoretically founded method for performing Principal Component Analysis {(PCA)} with spiking neurons. By applying this rule to an ensemble of neurons, different principal components of the input can be extracted. In addition, it is possible to preferentially extract those principal components from incoming signals $X$ that are related or are not related to some additional target signal $Y_T$. In a biological interpretation, this target signal $Y_T$ (also called relevance variable) could represent proprioceptive feedback, input from other sensory modalities, or top-down signals.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Under natural viewing conditions, human observers shift their gaze to allocate processing resources to subsets of the visual input. Many computational models have aimed at predicting such voluntary attentional shifts. Although the importance of high level stimulus properties (higher order statistics, semantics) stands undisputed, most models are based on low-level features of the input alone. In this study we recorded eye-movements of human observers while they viewed photographs of natural scenes. About two thirds of the stimuli contained at least one person. We demonstrate that a combined model of face detection and low-level saliency clearly outperforms a low-level model in predicting locations humans fixate. This is reflected in our finding fact that observes, even when not instructed to look for anything particular, fixate on a face with a probability of over 80% within their first two fixations (500ms). Remarkably, the model's predictive performance in images that do not contain faces is not impaired by spurious face detector responses, which is suggestive of a bottom-up mechanism for face detection. In summary, we provide a novel computational approach which combines high level object knowledge (in our case: face locations) with low-level features to successfully predict the allocation of attentional resources.</td>\n",

We then develop and apply unsupervised author-topic, probabilistic models to automatically discover the topics embedded in the code and extract topic-word and author-topic distributions. In addition to serving as a convenient summary for program function and developer activities, these and other related distributions provide a statistical and information-theoretic basis for quantifying and analyzing developer similarity and competence, topic scattering, and document tangling, with direct applications to software engineering.

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the neural mechanism responsible for solving ICA. We present an online learning rule that exploits delayed correlations in the input.

Empirical results have shown its favorable performance in comparison with several other popular clustering algorithms. However, the inherent relationship between subspace selection and clustering in this framework is not well understood, due to the iterative nature of the algorithm. We show in this paper that this iterative subspace selection and clustering is equivalent to kernel K-means with a specific kernel Gram matrix. This provides significant and new insights into the nature of this subspace selection procedure. Based on this equivalence relationship, we propose the Discriminative K-means (DisKmeans) algorithm for simultaneous LDA subspace selection and clustering, as well as an automatic parameter estimation procedure. We also present the nonlinear extension of DisKmeans using kernels. We show that the learning of the kernel matrix over a convex set of pre-specified kernel matrices can be incorporated into the clustering formulation. The connection between DisKmeans and several other clustering algorithms is also analyzed.

We prove that the algorithm can provide approximate solution within arbitrary accuracy when $G$ excludes some finite sized graph as its minor and G has bounded degree: all Planar graphs with bounded degree are examples of such graphs. The running time of the algorithm is $\\Theta(n)$ (n is the number of nodes in G), with constant dependent on accuracy, degree of graph and size of the graph that is excluded as a minor (constant for Planar graphs). Our algorithm for minor-excluded graphs uses the decomposition scheme of Klein, Plotkin and Rao (1993).

This allows the comparison of ranking functions when clicks are available but complete relevance judgments are not. After an initial training phase using a set of relevance judgments paired with click data, we show that our model can predict the relevance score of documents that have not been judged. These predictions can be used to evaluate the performance of a search engine, using our novel formalization of the confidence of the standard evaluation metric discounted cumulative gain (DCG), so comparisons can be made across time and datasets. This contrasts with previous methods which can provide only pair-wise relevance judgements between results shown for the same query. When no relevance judgments are available, we can identify the better of two ranked lists up to 82% of the time, and with only two relevance judgments for each query, we can identify the better ranking up to 94% of the time. While our experiments are on sponsored search results, which is the financial backbone of web search, our method is general enough to be applicable to algorithmic web search results as well. Furthermore, we give an algorithm to guide the selection of additional documents to judge to improve confidence.</td>\n",

Second, we rigorously prove that using only this set of random projections, we can estimate the structure of the underlying manifold.

To handle practical situations, we develop a greedy algorithm to estimate the smallest size of the projection space required to perform manifold learning.

This representation provides a distribution of spikes corresponding to the primitive activations, which can also be modelled using HMM architectures. We show how the coupling of the low level primitive model, and the higher level timing model during inference can produce good reconstructions of handwriting, with shared primitives for all characters modelled.

The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels.

Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements.  Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together.  Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.</td>\n",

The proposed model, named Cross-Spectral Factor Analysis (CSFA), breaks the observed signal into factors defined by unique spatio-spectral properties. These properties are granted to the factors via a Gaussian process formulation in a multiple kernel learning framework. In this way, the LFP signals can be mapped to a lower dimensional space in a way that retains information of relevance to neuroscientists.  Critically, the factors are interpretable.

We first introduce the problem of stochastic submodular optimization, where one needs to optimize a submodular objective which is given as an expectation. Our model captures situations where the discrete objective arises as an empirical risk (e.g., in the case of exemplar-based clustering), or is given as an explicit stochastic model (e.g., in the case of influence maximization in social networks). By exploiting that common extensions act linearly on the class of submodular functions, we employ projected stochastic gradient ascent and its variants in the continuous domain, and perform rounding to obtain discrete solutions. We focus on the rich and widely used family of weighted coverage functions.

In particular, identifying a good hierarchical structure is at the same time a fundamental and challenging problem for several applications. The amount of data to analyze is increasing at an astonishing rate each day. Hence there is a need for new solutions to efficiently compute effective hierarchical clusterings on such huge data.  The main focus of this paper is on minimum spanning tree (MST) based clusterings. In particular, we propose affinity, a novel hierarchical clustering based on Boruvka's MST algorithm. We prove certain theoretical guarantees for affinity (as well as some other classic algorithms) and show that in practice it is superior to several other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.   Furthermore, we present two MapReduce implementations for affinity. The first one works for the case where the input graph is dense and takes constant rounds. It is based on a Massively Parallel MST algorithm for dense graphs that improves upon the state-of-the-art algorithm of Lattanzi et al. (SPAA 2011). Our second algorithm has no assumption on the density of the input graph and finds the affinity clustering in $O(\\log n)$ rounds using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs).

       "      <td>Bayesian online algorithms for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) need to update their posterior distribution after seeing one single additional instance. To do so, they must compute moments of the model parameters under this distribution. The best existing method for computing such moments scales quadratically in the size of the SPN, although it scales linearly for trees. This unfortunate scaling makes Bayesian online algorithms prohibitively expensive, except for small or tree-structured SPNs. We propose an optimal linear-time algorithm that works even when the SPN is a general directed acyclic graph (DAG), which significantly broadens the applicability of Bayesian online algorithms for SPNs. There are three key ingredients in the design and analysis of our algorithm: 1). For each edge in the graph, we construct a linear time reduction from the moment computation problem to a joint inference problem in SPNs. 2). Using the property that each SPN computes a multilinear polynomial, we give an efficient procedure for polynomial evaluation by differentiation without expanding the network that may contain exponentially many monomials. 3). We propose a dynamic programming method to further reduce the computation of the moments of all the edges in the graph from quadratic to linear. We demonstrate the usefulness of our linear time algorithm by applying it to develop a linear time assume density filter (ADF) for SPNs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is important for intelligent systems, e.g. autonomous vehicles and robotics to anticipate the future in order to plan early and make decisions accordingly. Predicting the future scene parsing and motion dynamics helps the agents better understand the visual environment better as the former provides dense semantic segmentations, i.e. what objects will be present and where they will appear, while the latter provides dense motion information, i.e. how the objects move in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel model to predict the scene parsing and motion dynamics in unobserved future video frames simultaneously. Using history information (preceding frames and corresponding scene parsing results) as input, our model is able to predict the scene parsing and motion for arbitrary time steps ahead. More importantly, our model is superior compared to other methods that predict parsing and motion separately, as the complementary relationship between the two tasks are fully utilized in our model through joint learning. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics in the future frames. On the large-scale Cityscapes dataset, it is demonstrated that our model produces significantly better parsing and motion prediction results compared to well established baselines. In addition, we also show our model can be used to predict the steering angle of the vehicles, which further verifies the ability of our model to learn underlying latent parameters.</td>\n",

A commonly used notion of similarity is the number of matches between k-mers (k-length subsequences) in the two sequences. Extending this definition, by considering two k-mers to match if their distance is at most m, yields better classification performance. This, however, makes the problem computationally much more complex. Known algorithms to compute this similarity have computational complexity that render them applicable only for small values of k and m. In this work, we develop novel techniques to efficiently and accurately estimate the pairwise similarity score, which enables us to use much larger values of k and m, and get higher predictive accuracy. This opens up a broad avenue of applying this classification approach to audio, images, and text sequences. Our algorithm achieves excellent approximation performance with theoretical guarantees. In the process we solve an open combinatorial problem, which was posed as a major hindrance to the scalability of existing solutions.

A number of recent papers provided convergence rate estimates for their deterministic (cyclic) and randomized variants that differ in the selection of update coordinates. These estimates suggest randomized coordinate descent (RCD) performs better than cyclic coordinate descent (CCD), although numerical experiments do not provide clear justification for this comparison. In this paper, we provide examples and more generally problem classes for which CCD (or CD with any deterministic order) is faster than RCD in terms of asymptotic worst-case convergence. Furthermore, we provide lower and upper bounds on the amount of improvement on the rate of CCD relative to RCD, which depends on the deterministic order used. We also provide a characterization of the best deterministic order (that leads to the maximum improvement in convergence rate) in terms of the combinatorial properties of the Hessian matrix of the objective function.</td>\n",

If so, it saves the oracle query for later use in more difficult cases, and if not it queries the human oracle.  The paper develops the new algorithm to exhibit this behavior and proves a theoretical mistake bound for the method compared to the best linear predictor in hindsight. Experiments over three multitask learning benchmark datasets show clearly superior performance over baselines such as assuming task independence, learning only from the oracle and not learning from peer tasks.</td>\n",

Here, the challenge is to learn accurate \"few-shot'' models for classes in the tail of the class distribution, for which little data is available. We cast this problem as transfer learning, where knowledge from the data-rich classes in the head of the distribution is transferred to the data-poor classes in the tail. Our key insights are as follows. First, we propose to transfer meta-knowledge about learning-to-learn from the head classes. This knowledge is encoded with a meta-network that operates on the space of model parameters, that is trained to predict many-shot model parameters from few-shot model parameters.  Second, we transfer this meta-knowledge in a progressive manner, from classes in the head to the \"body'', and from the \"body'' to the tail. That is, we transfer knowledge in a gradual fashion, regularizing meta-networks for few-shot regression with those trained with more training data. This allows our final network to capture a notion of model dynamics, that predicts how model parameters are likely to change as more training data is gradually added. We demonstrate results on image classification datasets (SUN, Places, and ImageNet) tuned for the long-tailed setting, that significantly outperform common heuristics, such as data resampling or reweighting.</td>\n",

The feedback is correct only with probability p &gt; 1/2 (and adversarially incorrect with probability 1 - p), i.e., the algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise. The algorithm's goal is to learn the ground truth model using few iterations.  Our general framework is based on a graph representation of the models and user feedback. To be able to learn efficiently, it is sufficient that there be a graph G whose nodes are the models, and (weighted) edges capture the user feedback, with the property that if s, s* are the proposed and target models, respectively, then any (correct) user feedback s' must lie on a shortest s-s* path in G. Under this one assumption, there is a natural algorithm, reminiscent of the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, which will efficiently learn s* even in the presence of noise in the user's feedback.

       "1     Spike-triggered averaging techniques are effective for linear characterization of neural responses. But neurons exhibit important nonlinear behaviors, such as gain control, that are not captured by such analyses. We describe a spike-triggered covariance method for retrieving suppressive components of the gain control signal in a neuron. We demonstrate the method in simulation and on retinal ganglion cell data. Analysis of physiological data reveals significant suppressive axes and explains neural nonlinearities. This method should be applicable to other sensory areas and modalities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "3     We present the first truly polynomial algorithm for learning the structure of bounded-treewidth junction trees -- an attractive subclass of probabilistic graphical models that permits both the compact representation of probability distributions and efficient exact inference. For a constant treewidth, our algorithm has polynomial time and sample complexity, and provides strong theoretical guarantees in terms of $KL$ divergence from the true distribution. We also present a lazy extension of our approach that leads to very significant speed ups in practice, and demonstrate the viability of our method empirically, on several real world datasets. One of our key new theoretical insights is a method for bounding the conditional mutual information of arbitrarily large sets of random variables with only a polynomial number of mutual information computations on fixed-size subsets of variables, when the underlying distribution can be approximated by a bounded treewidth junction tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "4     Semi-supervised inductive learning concerns how to learn a decision rule from a data set containing both labeled and unlabeled data. Several boosting algorithms have been extended to semi-supervised learning with various strategies. To our knowledge, however, none of them takes local smoothness constraints among data into account during ensemble learning. In this paper, we introduce a local smoothness regularizer to semi-supervised boosting algorithms based on the universal optimization framework of margin cost functionals. Our regularizer is applicable to existing semi-supervised boosting algorithms to improve their generalization and speed up their training. Comparative results on synthetic, benchmark and real world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our local smoothness regularizer. We discuss relevant issues and relate our regularizer to previous work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "3919  We revisit the classical analysis of generative vs discriminative models for general exponential families, and high-dimensional settings. Towards this, we develop novel technical machinery, including a notion of separability of general loss functions, which allow us to provide a general framework to obtain l? convergence rates for general M-estimators. We use this machinery to analyze l? and l2 convergence rates of generative and discriminative models, and provide insights into their nuanced behaviors in high-dimensions. Our results are also applicable to differential parameter estimation, where the quantity of interest is the difference between generative model parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "3921  Community detection, which focuses on clustering nodes or detecting communities in (mostly) a single network, is a problem of considerable practical interest and has received a great deal of attention in the  research community. While being able to cluster within a network is important, there are emerging needs to be able to \\emph{cluster multiple networks}. This is largely motivated by the routine collection of network data that are generated from potentially different populations. These networks may or may not have node correspondence. When node correspondence is present, we cluster networks by summarizing a network by its graphon estimate, whereas when node correspondence is not present, we propose a novel solution for clustering such networks by associating a computationally feasible feature vector to each network based on trace of powers of the adjacency matrix. We illustrate our methods using both simulated and real data sets, and theoretical justifications are provided in terms of consistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3922  We propose a general framework for interactively learning models, such as (binary or non-binary) classifiers, orderings/rankings of items, or clusterings of data points. Our framework is based on a generalization of Angluin's equivalence query model and Littlestone's online learning model: in each iteration, the algorithm proposes a model, and the user either accepts it or reveals a specific mistake in the proposal. The feedback is correct only with probability p > 1/2 (and adversarially incorrect with probability 1 - p), i.e., the algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise. The algorithm's goal is to learn the ground truth model using few iterations.  Our general framework is based on a graph representation of the models and user feedback. To be able to learn efficiently, it is sufficient that there be a graph G whose nodes are the models, and (weighted) edges capture the user feedback, with the property that if s, s* are the proposed and target models, respectively, then any (correct) user feedback s' must lie on a shortest s-s* path in G. Under this one assumption, there is a natural algorithm, reminiscent of the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, which will efficiently learn s* even in the presence of noise in the user's feedback.  From this general result, we rederive with barely any extra effort classic results on learning of classifiers and a recent result on interactive clustering; in addition, we easily obtain new interactive learning algorithms for ordering/ranking.  \n",
       "3923  We consider maximum likelihood estimation of linear dynamical systems with generalized-linear observation models. Maximum likelihood is typically considered to be hard in this setting since latent states and transition parameters must be inferred jointly. Given that expectation-maximization does not scale and is prone to local minima, moment-matching approaches from the subspace identification literature have become standard, despite known statistical efficiency issues. In this paper, we instead reconsider likelihood maximization and develop an optimization based strategy for recovering the latent states and transition parameters. Key to the approach is a two-view reformulation of maximum likelihood estimation for linear dynamical systems that enables the use of global optimization algorithms for matrix factorization. We show that the proposed estimation strategy outperforms widely-used identification algorithms such as subspace identification methods, both in terms of accuracy and runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

The region of phase space is\\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\\nselection of events.\\n</td>\n",

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees\\nwith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the\\nMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil\\nevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5\\nbillion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests\\nthat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the\\nEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from\\nEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts\\nthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate\\nabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).\\n</td>\n",

These objects\\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies.

       "2    The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field\\nfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,\\nAmerican Physical Society.

       "7    A general formulation was developed to represent material models for\\napplications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate\\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example\\ncalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects\\nof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and\\nshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8    We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy\\nobservations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set\\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\\n   \n",
       "9    Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph\\ndefined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play\\nan important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed\\nin the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary\\ndimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known\\nresults are given.\\n  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and\\ncontraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes\\nfrom old ones.
